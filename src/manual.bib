  Abstract                 = {DNA polymerases require two divalent metal ions in the active site for catalysis. Mg2+ has been confirmed to be the most probable cation utilized by most polymerases in vivo. Other metal ions are either potent mutagens or inhibitors. We used structural and topological analyses based on ab initioQM/MM calculations to study human DNA polymerase [small lambda] (Pol[small lambda]) with different metals in the active site. Our results indicate a slightly longer O3[prime or minute]-P[small alpha] distance ([similar]3.6 A) for most inhibitor cations compared to the natural and mutagenic metals ([similar]3.3-3.4 A). Optimization with a larger basis set for the previously reported transition state (TS) structures (Cisneros et al., DNA Repair, 2008, 7, 1824.) gives barriers of 17.4 kcal mol-1 and 15.1 kcal mol-1 for the Mg2+ and Mn2+ catalyzed reactions respectively. Relying on the key relation between the topological signature of a metal cation and its selectivity within biological systems (de Courcy et al., J. Chem. Theor. Comput., 2010, 6, 1048.) we have performed electron localization function (ELF) topological analyses. These analyses show that all inhibitor and mutagenic metals considered, except Na+, present a "split" of the outer-shell density of the metal. This "splitting" is not observed for the non-mutagenic Mg2+ metal. Population and multipole analyses on the ELF basins reveal that the electronic dipolar and quadrupolar polarization is significantly different with Mg2+ compared to all other cations. Our results shed light at the atomic level on the subtle differences between Mg2+, mutagenic, and inhibitor metals in DNA polymerases. These results provide a correlation between the electronic distribution of the cations in the active site and the possible consequences on DNA synthesis.},

  Abstract                 = {This work reviews the increasing evidence that many-body van der Waals (vdW) or dispersion interactions play a crucial role in the structure, stability and function of a wide variety of systems in biology, chemistry and physics. Starting with the exact expression for the electron correlation energy provided by the adiabatic connection fluctuationâdissipation theorem, we derive both pairwise and many-body interatomic methods for computing the long-range dispersion energy by considering a model system of coupled quantum harmonic oscillators within the random-phase approximation. By coupling this approach to density functional theory, the resulting many-body dispersion (MBD) method provides an accurate and efficient scheme for computing the frequency-dependent polarizability and many-body vdW energy in molecules and materials with a finite electronic gap. A select collection of applications are presented that ascertain the fundamental importance of these non-bonded interactions across the spectrum of intermolecular (the S22 and S66 benchmark databases), intramolecular (conformational energies of alanine tetrapeptide) and supramolecular (binding energy of the âbuckyball catcherâ) complexes, as well as molecular crystals (cohesive energies in oligoacenes). These applications demonstrate that electrodynamic response screening and beyond-pairwise many-body vdW interactionsâboth captured at the MBD level of theoryâplay a quantitative, and sometimes even qualitative, role in describing the properties considered herein. This work is then concluded with an in-depth discussion of the challenges that remain in the future development of reliable (accurate and efficient) methods for treating many-body vdW interactions in complex materials and provides a roadmap for navigating many of the research avenues that are yet to be explored.},

  Abstract                 = {The incorporation of dNMPs into DNA by polymerases involves a phosphoryl transfer reaction hypothesized to require two divalent metal ions. Here we investigate this hypothesis using as a model human DNA polymerase Î» (Pol Î»), an enzyme suggested to be activated in vivo by manganese. We report the crystal structures of four complexes of human Pol Î». In a 1.9 Ã structure of Pol Î» containing a 3â²-OH and the non-hydrolyzable analog dUpnpp, a non-catalytic Na+ ion occupies the site for metal A and the ribose of the primer-terminal nucleotide is found in a conformation that positions the acceptor 3â²-OH out of line with the Î±-phosphate and the bridging oxygen of the pyrophosphate leaving group. Soaking this crystal in MnCl2 yielded a 2.0 Ã structure with Mn2+ occupying the site for metal A. In the presence of Mn2+, the conformation of the ribose is C3â²-endo and the 3â²-oxygen is in line with the leaving oxygen, at a distance from the phosphorus atom of the Î±-phosphate (3.69 Ã) consistent with and supporting a catalytic mechanism involving two divalent metal ions. Finally, soaking with MnCl2 converted a pre-catalytic Pol Î»/Na+ complex with unreacted dCTP in the active site into a product complex via catalysis in the crystal. These data provide pre- and post-transition state information and outline in a single crystal the pathway for the phosphoryl transfer reaction carried out by DNA polymerases.},

  Abstract                 = {Density-functional theory (DFT) has provided insights into various materials properties in the recent decade. However, its computational complexity has made other aspects, especially those involving defects, beyond reach. Here, we present a method that enables the study of multi-million atom clusters using orbital-free density-functional theory (OFDFT) with no spurious physics or restrictions on geometry. The key ideas are: (i) a real-space formulation; (ii) a nested finite-element implementation of the formulation and (iii) a systematic means of adaptive coarse-graining retaining full resolution where necessary and coarsening elsewhere with no patches, assumptions or structure. We demonstrate the method, its accuracy under modest computational cost and the physical insights it offers by studying one and two vacancies in aluminum crystals consisting of millions of atoms.},

  Abstract                 = {The prion protein (PrP) is responsible for a group of neurodegenerative diseases called the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. The normal function of PrP has not yet been discovered, but indirect evidence suggests a linkage to its ability to bind copper. In this article, low-copper-concentration bindings of Cu2+ to PrP are investigated by using a recently developed hybrid density functional theory (DFT)/DFT method. It is found that at the lowest copper concentrations, the binding site consists of 4 histidine residues coordinating the copper through ε imidazole nitrogens. At higher concentrations, 2 histidines are involved in the binding, one of them in the axial position. These results are in good agreement with existing experimental data. Comparison of free energies for all modes of coordination shows that when enough copper is available, the binding sites will spontaneously rearrange to accommodate more copper ions, despite the fact that binding energy per copper ion decreases with concentration. These findings support the hypothesis that PrP acts as a copper buffer in vivo, protecting other proteins from the attachment of copper ions. Using large-scale classical molecular dynamics, we also probe the structure of full-length copper-bound PrP, including its unfolded N-terminal domain. The results show that copper attachment leads to rearrangement of the structure of the Cu-bonded octarepeat region and to development of turns in areas separating copper-bound residues. These turns make the flexible N-terminal domain more rigid and thus more resistant to misfolding. The last result suggests that copper binding plays a beneficial role in the initial stages of prion diseases.},

  Abstract                 = {A fast and accurate Quantum Mechanics/Molecular Mechanics method is described for thermodynamic simulation of solutes (or active sites in flexible molecules) in polar environments. The solute is described quantum mechanically and is held fixed during averaging over solvent configurations, which are described by Molecular Mechanics. Quantum calculations during simulation are replaced by the evaluation of the response of the solute to the long range electric field of the solvent, using precalculated generalized electric moments and polarizabilities. This results in huge decrease of computational time without affecting the accuracy of the QM/MM results. Implementation in a Monte Carlo program accelerated the simulations of guanine and the phenylalanine dipeptide in TIP3P water by over four orders of magnitude. Polarizability is essential for accuracy. Its inclusion decreases the average signed energy error and its standard deviation from 5.69 to 0.003 and 1.22 to 0.013 kcal/mol, respectively, for the dipeptide. Hyperpolarizability contributions are insignificant.},

  Abstract                 = {Three parallel algorithms for classical molecular dynamics are presented. The first assigns each processor a fixed subset of atoms; the second assigns each a fixed subset of inter-atomic forces to compute; the third assigns each a fixed spatial region. The algorithms are suitable for molecular dynamics models which can be difficult to parallelize efficiently--those with short-range forces where the neighbors of each atom change rapidly. They can be implemented on any distributed-memory parallel machine which allows for message-passing of data between independently executing processors. The algorithms are tested on a standard Lennard-Jones benchmark problem for system sizes ranging from 500 to 100,000,000 atoms on several parallel supercomputers--the nCUBE 2, Intel iPSC/860 and Paragon, and Cray T3D. Comparing the results to the fastest reported vectorized Cray Y-MP and C90 algorithm shows that the current generation of parallel machines is competitive with conventional vector supercomputers even for small problems. For large problems, the spatial algorithm achieves parallel efficiencies of 90% and a 1840-node Intel Paragon performs up to 165 faster than a single Cray C9O processor. Trade-offs between the three algorithms and guidelines for adapting them to more complex molecular dynamics simulations are also discussed.},
