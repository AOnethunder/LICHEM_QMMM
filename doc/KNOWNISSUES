General:
-Currently only DFT and HF energies can be used in most of the QM
calculations. Post-HF methods are currently only implemented in PSI4
and semiempirical methods are currently only implemented in Gaussian.

Gaussian interface:
-Using the external interface to Gaussian interferes with timing the MM
wrapper. This is harmless, but the statistics should not be trusted when
optimizations are performed with the native Gaussian optimizer.
-The external interface is currently not working.

NWChem interface:
-NWChem calculations can only be performed with DFT. Wavefunction based
methods are not implemented.
-Optimizations with the native NWChem optimizer (Calculation_type: Opt) cannot
be performed. However, optimizations can be performed with the LICHEM
optimizers. Pure QM optimizations within NWChem will be implemented in the
future.

TINKER interface:
-Chiral atoms with multipoles have not been thoroughly tested in QMMM
simulations.

LAMMPS interface:
-The LAMMPS wrapper is still in the early stages of development.

AMBER interface:
-The AMBER wrapper is still in the early stages of development.

PIMC:
-NPT Monte Carlo has a volume change bug. This is being investigated, but
NPT MC is low priority.

Manual:
-The theory sections need citations.
-Better descriptions of the simulations methods should be given (i.e. DFP vs
Opt).
-The theory for path-integral calculations needs to be documented.
