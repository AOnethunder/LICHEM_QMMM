General:
-Currently only DFT and HF energies can be used in the calculations. Post-HF
methods will be implemented in the future.
-MM wrappers can easily include PBC, but only the NWChem wrapper can handle
PBC for QM calculations. The QM region should always be placed near the center
of the simulation box.

NWChem interface:
-NWChem calculations can only be performed with DFT. Wavefunction based
methods are not implemented.
-Optimizations with the native NWChem optimizer (Calculation_type: Opt) cannot
be performed. However, DFP, SD, and ESD are implemented. Pure QM optimizations
within NWChem will be implemented in the future.

PSI4 interface:
-PSI4 gradients do not include the contribution from the external field.
This is not a FLUKE bug, but rather a bug in PSI4. Due to this bug, PSI4 QMMM
optimizations currently do not work.

TINKER interface:
-Chiral atoms with multipoles have not been tested. It is possible that these
interactions are incorrect.

LAMMPS interface:
-The LAMMPS wrapper is currently being rewritten.

Gaussian interface:
-Using the external interface to gaussian interferes with timing the MM
wrapper. This is harmless, but the statistics should not be trusted in the
external optimizations.

Optimization:
-The steepest descent and DFP optimizers use Cartesian coordinates.
-The DFP optimizer included in Optimizers.cpp does not have a true line
search algorithm. Instead, the optimizer will take a small steepest descent
step (and create a new guess Hessian) if the QMMM energy rises. It will also
create a new Hessian if the optimization does not converge within 30 steps.

Manual:
-The theory sections need citations
-Better descriptions of the simulations methods should be given (i.e. DFP vs
Opt).
