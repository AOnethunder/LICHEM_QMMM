Compiling:
-LICHEM has only been compiled and tested on Linux machines.
-GCC v5 prints a warning about statically linking 'dlopen' with glibc/libgomp.
So far I have not seen this cause any errors on Linux machines. If the warning
causes concern, it can be eliminated by removing "-static" from the list of
CXXFLAGS in the Makefile.

General:
-Currently only DFT and HF energies can be used in most of the QM
calculations. Post-HF methods are currently only implemented in PSI4
(closed shell) and semiempirical methods are currently only implemented in
Gaussian.
-MM wrappers can easily include PBC, but only the NWChem wrapper can handle
PBC for QM calculations. The QM region should always be placed near the center
of the simulation box.

Gaussian interface:
-Using the external interface to Gaussian interferes with timing the MM
wrapper. This is harmless, but the statistics should not be trusted when
optimizations are performed with the native Gaussian optimizer.

PSI4 interface:
-The PSI4 wrapper coded and tested using the development version of PSI4.
It is recommended to use the anaconda version of PSI4.

NWChem interface:
-NWChem calculations can only be performed with DFT. Wavefunction based
methods are not implemented.
-Optimizations with the native NWChem optimizer (Calculation_type: Opt) cannot
be performed. However, optimizations can be performed with the LICHEM
optimizers. Pure QM optimizations within NWChem will be implemented in the
future.
-The accuracy of the QMMM PBC calculations has not been tested.

TINKER interface:
-Chiral atoms with multipoles have not been thoroughly tested in QMMM
simulations. It is possible that these interactions are incorrect. Note that
even if the interactions are not treated properly, the errors should be
insignificant if the chiral atoms are far from the QM region.
-All QM point charges are added as Z-then-X multipoles. Since only the
monopole is retained, the frame of reference is not important.

LAMMPS interface:
-The LAMMPS wrapper is currently being rewritten.

AMBER interface:
-The AMBER wrapper is still in the early stages of development.

Optimization:
-The DFP optimizers included in Optimizers.cpp and Reaction_path.cpp do not
have true line search algorithms. Instead, the optimizers will take a small
steepest descent step (and create a new guess Hessian) if the QMMM energy
rises. It will also create a new Hessian if the optimization does not converge
within 30 steps or if the optimization direction is orthogonal to the forces.
The optimization procedure is inefficient for gas phase QM optimizations, but
works well for difficult QMMM systems.

PIMC:
-NPT Monte Carlo has a volume change bug. This is being investigated, but
NPT MC is low priority.

Testing:
-The test set needs to be expanded beyond single-point energies.

Manual:
-The theory sections need citations
-Better descriptions of the simulations methods should be given (i.e. DFP vs
Opt).
-The theory for path-integral calculations needs to be documented.
