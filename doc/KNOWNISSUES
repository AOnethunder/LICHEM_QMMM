Withheld features:
-The multipole code will not be fully released until after the work is
published.
-The frozen density code will not be fully released until after the work is
published.
-The reaction pathway code will not be fully released until after the work is
published.

General:
-Molecular dynamics simulations are currently broken, a fix is in progress

PSI4 interface:
-PSI4 gradients do not include the contribution from the external field.
This is not a FLUKE bug, but rather a bug in PSI4. Due to this bug, PSI4 QMMM
optimizations currently do not work.

TINKER interface:
-Chiral atoms with multipoles have not been tested. It is possible that these
interactions are incorrect.

LAMMPS interface:
-The LAMMPS wrapper needs to be rewritten. The version that is in the source
directory is not configured properly.

Gaussian interface:
-Transition state optimizations are currently broken.

DFP optimization:
-The steepest descent and DFP optimizers use Cartesian coordinates.
-The DFP optimizer included in Optimizers.cpp does not have a true line
search algorithm. Instead, the optimizer will create a new guess Hessian
and take a small steepest descent step if the QMMM energy rises.
