Withheld features:
-The multipole code will not be fully released until after the work is
published.
-The frozen density code will not be fully released until after the work is
published.
-The reaction pathway code will not be fully released until after the work is
published.

General:
-Molecular dynamics simulations are currently broken, a fix is in progress
-Currently only DFT and HF energies can be used in the calculations. Post-HF
methods will be implemented in the future.

PSI4 interface:
-PSI4 gradients do not include the contribution from the external field.
This is not a FLUKE bug, but rather a bug in PSI4. Due to this bug, PSI4 QMMM
optimizations currently do not work.

TINKER interface:
-Chiral atoms with multipoles have not been tested. It is possible that these
interactions are incorrect.

LAMMPS interface:
-The LAMMPS wrapper needs to be rewritten. The version that is in the source
directory is not configured properly.

Gaussian interface:
-Transition state optimizations are currently broken.

Optimization:
-The steepest descent and DFP optimizers use Cartesian coordinates.
-The DFP optimizer included in Optimizers.cpp does not have a true line
search algorithm. Instead, the optimizer will take a small steepest descent
step (and create a new guess Hessian) if the QMMM energy rises.

Manual:
-The theory sections need citations
-Better descriptions of the simulations methods should be given (i.e. DFP vs
Opt).
-A section which details the programming style and practices should be added
for developers
