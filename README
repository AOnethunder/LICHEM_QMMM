FLUKE: Fields Layered Under Kohn-Sham Electrons
A QMMM interface for polarizable force fields

This package is designed to be an open source (GPLv3) interface between QM
and MM software so that QMMM calculations can be performed with polarizable
and frozen density force fields. Functionality is also present for standard
point-charge based force fields.

Available calculations: single-point energies, optimized geometries,
classical Monte Carlo, path-integral Monte Carlo, and reaction pathways

Available QM wrappers: Gaussian, PSI4

Available MM wrappers: TINKER, Amber, LAMMPS

Note: This software is still in alpha. Not all features will work properly.
Please report all bugs or missing features so that the code can be updated
quickly.
