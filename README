LICHEM: Layered Interacting CHEmical Models
A QMMM interface for polarizable force fields

### Introduction ###

This package is designed to be an open source (GPLv3) interface between QM
and MM software so that QMMM calculations can be performed with polarizable
and frozen density force fields. Functionality is also present for standard
point-charge based force fields.

Available calculations: single-point energies, optimized geometries, classical
molecular dynamics, classical Monte Carlo, path-integral Monte Carlo, and
reaction pathways

Available QM wrappers: Gaussian, NWChem, PSI4

Available MM wrappers: TINKER, AMBER, LAMMPS

Note: Some features will be held back until the research is published. Please
report all bugs so that the code can be updated quickly. Bug fixes are
released on a rolling basis, while major updates are developed and tested in a
private repository. A list of known issues and the development timeline are
available in the doc directory. 

### Installation ###

Currently, the binary and user's manual are not included in the repository.
The Makefile can be used to generate both files. Since LICHEM is designed to
be simple, only a small number of packages are required to compile the code.
An approximate list of packages is given below.
  LICHEM binary: OpenMP, Eigen3
  LICHEM manual: LaTeX, BibTeX

Clone the git repository
user:$ mkdir LICHEM
user:$ git clone https://github.com/kratman/LICHEM_QMMM.git ./LICHEM/

On Ubuntu boxes, the compile script should function without modifications.
However, with other operating systems it may be necessary to change the path
to the Eigen3 package.

Default: -I/usr/include/eigen3/

The Makefile produces both the documentation and the binary.

user:$ make install
