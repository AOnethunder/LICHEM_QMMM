FLUKE: Fields Layered Under Kohn-Sham Electrons
A QMMM interface for polarizable force fields

This package is designed to be an interface between QM and MM software
so that QMMM calculations can be performed with polarizable and frozen
density force fields.

Available calculations: single-point energies, optimized geometries,
classical Monte Carlo, path-integral Monte Carlo, and reaction pathways

Available QM wrappers: Gaussian, PSI4

Available MM wrappers: TINKER, Amber, LAMMPS

Note: This software is still in alpha, not all features will work properly.
